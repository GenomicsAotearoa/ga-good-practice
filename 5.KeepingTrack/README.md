## Keeping Track of Changes


 1. Back up (almost) everything created by a human being as soon as it is created.
 2. Keep changes small.
 3. Share changes frequently.
 4. Create, maintain, and use a checklist for saving and sharing changes to the project.
 5. Store each project in a folder that is mirrored off the researcher's working machine.
 6. Add a file called CHANGELOG.txt to the project's docs subfolder.
 7. Copy the entire project whenever a significant change has been made.
 8. Use a version control system.
